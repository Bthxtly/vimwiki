Let $X_1$, $X_2$, \ldots, $X_n$ be a sequence of independent and
identically distributed random variables with
$E[X_i] = \mu$ and $\operatorname{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, 
and let
\begin{equation}
S_n = \frac1n \sum_{i=1}^n X_i
\end{equation}

denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the
random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in
distribution to a normal $N(0, \sigma^2)$.
